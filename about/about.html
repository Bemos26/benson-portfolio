    <h2>Meet Benson Mose</h2>

    <p>Benson Mose is a developer, designer, and musician based in Nairobi, Kenya. With a foundation in mathematics and computer science, he blends technical precision with creative expression to build solutions that are both functional and beautiful.</p>

    <p>His journey spans multiple domains — from backend development and data visualization to graphic design and music arrangement. Benson thrives on understanding systems deeply, whether he's debugging C code, customizing his development environment, or conducting a brass ensemble.</p>

    <p>He’s known for his resourcefulness and clarity: organizing his workspace with custom folders and PATH management, troubleshooting hardware and software issues with ease, and always asking “why” to get to the root of a problem.</p>

    <p>Beyond the screen, Benson is a national-level musician, having performed and led bands at prestigious festivals. His trumpet and piano skills are matched by his ability to arrange music and guide ensembles with precision and passion.</p>

    <p>He integrates philosophical and spiritual frameworks into his work, drawing from biblical principles and daily practices like prayer to stay grounded and intentional. His approach to learning is holistic — technical, creative, and spiritual.</p>

    <p>Recent additions to his toolkit include Dart, Flutter, and Canva, which he uses to build cross-platform apps and design visuals for educational platforms and personal branding. He’s also exploring prompt engineering and AI collaboration to enhance productivity and creativity.</p>

    <p>Whether building a portfolio, mentoring peers, or reflecting on the future of programming, Benson is driven by curiosity and built for impact.</p>
